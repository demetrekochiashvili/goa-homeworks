<h4>Kahoot! is a Norwegian online game-based learning platform.[3] It has learning games, also known as "kahoots", which are user-generated multiple-choice quizzes that can be accessed via a web browser or the Kahoot! app.[4][5]

    In July 2023, Kahoot agreed to be acquired by Goldman Sachs Asset Management alongside General Atlantic, Glitrafjord, and others in a $1.72 billion all-cash deal.[6]
    
    History and development
    Kahoot! was founded in 2012 by Morten Versvik, as well as a team of co-founders such as Johan Brand, Jamie Brooker and Asmund Furuseth in a joint project with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, collaborating with professor Alfe Inge Wang to develop the website.[2] Kahoot! was launched in a private beta in March 2013, and the beta was released to the public in September 2013.[2]
    
    In 2017, Kahoot! had raised $26.5 million in funding from Northzone, Creandum and Microsoft Ventures.[7] On October 11, 2018, Kahoot! was valued at $300 million.[8] As of 11 June 2020, Kahoot! was valued at $1.5 billion and raised further capital from Northzone.[9] In 2019, Kahoot! acquired the Scandinavian education company Poio.[10] It also acquired DragonBox, an educational games developer, for $18 million.[11] Kahoot! raised $28 million in venture capital investments the following June.[12] Kahoot! raised an additional $215 million in venture capital funding from SoftBank in October 2020.[13][14]
    
    Afterwards, Kahoot! made a series of acquisitions. It acquired Drops, which was focused on teaching languages, for about $50 million.[15] This was followed by Whiteboard.fi, which develops software for digital, online whiteboards.[16] Kahoot! also acquired the Danish startup Actimo for approximately $33 million. Actimo developed software for training and engaging with employees.[17] It was acquired to expand Kahoot's features for business users.[17] In March 2021, the company went public on the Oslo stock exchange.[18] In April 2021, Kahoot! acquired Motimate, a corporate learning company based in Norway, for about $25 million.[19] In 2021, Kahoot! announced that it would acquire SSO digital learning platform Clever, Inc. for $500 million to expand Clever Inc.'s reach globally.[20]
    
    Kahoot's user base grew more than 40 percent from 2020 to 2021.[18]</h4>

    <h1>Software and services</h1>

<br>
<h4> Kahoot! users gather around a common screen such as an interactive whiteboard, projector, or a computer monitor. The site can also be used through screen-sharing tools,[21] like Zoom or Google Hangouts.[22] The game design is such that the players are required to frequently look up from their devices. All players connect using a generated game PIN shown on the common screen, and use a device to answer questions.[citation needed]

    In March 2017, Kahoot! reached one billion cumulative participating players.[23] In September 2017, Kahoot! launched a mobile application for homework.[24]</h4>
